This is a very basic approach to extract the latest stories using Javascript.

To run the file in localhost
1. Install node.js - https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. Open command prompt from the folder and execute the following commands
   - npm install http-server -g
   - http-server
3. Server starts running. File will be available mentioned addresses in cmd

- After running the file in localhost, make sure to install a browser extension to enable CORS - 'Moesif Origins and CORS changer' for Chrome.
- https://time.com/ has enabled CORS
- Resultant JSON object array with the latest 6 stories is logged in console.
