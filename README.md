This is a very basic approach to extract the latest stories using Javascript.

To get latest stories from time.com (directly)
1. Run index.html
2. Make sure to install a browser extension to enable CORS(Request is blocked by CORS policy)
3. For Chrome - 'Moesif Origins and CORS changer' extension in Chrome Web store
4. Click 'Get Time Stories' button. 
5. Inspect page, JSON Object Array is logged in console

To run file in localhost
1. Install node.js - https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. Open command prompt from the folder and execute the following commands
   - npm install http-server -g
   - http-server
3. Server starts running. File will be available on mentioned addresses in cmd(make sure to install a browser extension to enable CORS)
4. Click 'Get Time Stories' button. 
5. Inspect page, JSON Object Array is logged in console
